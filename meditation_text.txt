Close your eyes and find a comfortable position. Take a deep breath in, and slowly exhale, letting go of any tension or stress. 

Imagine yourself standing on a beautiful seashore, feeling the warm sand beneath your feet. Hear the gentle sound of the waves crashing against the shore. As you breathe in, imagine the fresh, salty air filling your lungs, and as you exhale, feel any worries or thoughts leaving your body. 

Now, picture a gentle rain shower beginning to fall around you. Hear the soothing sound of raindrops hitting the ground and the leaves of nearby trees. Feel the cool droplets of rain on your skin, washing away any negative energy. 

Take a moment to focus on your breath. Inhale deeply, allowing your chest and abdomen to expand. Exhale slowly, feeling a sense of relaxation spreading throughout your body. 

As you continue to breathe, bring your attention to your thoughts and emotions. Notice any thoughts or worries that arise, but instead of holding onto them, imagine them floating away like clouds in the sky. Allow your mind to become clear and calm. 

Now, set an intention for this meditation. What do you wish to cultivate or let go of? Visualize this intention as a bright light within your heart, growing brighter with each breath. Feel the power of this intention filling your entire being. 

As the rain continues to fall and the waves crash against the shore, give yourself permission to fully experience the present moment. Allow yourself to be fully present, without judgment or expectation. 

Take a few more deep breaths, feeling the energy of the seashore and rain rejuvenating your mind, body, and soul. 

When you are ready, slowly open your eyes, bringing this sense of peace and tranquility with you into the rest of your day.
